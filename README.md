# Sara's Data Analyst Portfolio
Greeting! Welcome to my GitHub data analyst portfolio! I'm Sara and I'm on a thrilling journey as a Data Analyst. I'm  a passionate data analyst with a keen interest in extracting meaningful insights from data.üêçüìä
### Why I Love Data
Data, to me, is like a treasure map. It holds the path to better decisions, more efficient processes, and a world of possibilities. I am thrilled by the idea that every dataset is a new story waiting to be told.
### üåü My Mission
As a Data Analyst, I strive to make data accessible, actionable, and transformative. I'm on a quest to turn ordinary data into extraordinary insights and be a catalyst for positive change.
### Tools 
 ‚Ä¢ Python: A versatile programming language for data analysis, with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib that streamline data manipulation and visualization.                               
 ‚Ä¢ SQL: Structured Query Language for managing, querying, and analyzing relational databases.                                                                                          
 ‚Ä¢ Jupyter Notebooks: An interactive environment for coding and documenting data analysis, often used for sharing insights and results.
 ‚Ä¢ Power BI: A business analytics service by Microsoft for interactive data visualizations and business intelligence.
# Basket Analysis Project
### Overview
The Basket Analysis Project is a powerful data-driven initiative aimed at uncovering hidden insights within transaction data. This project leverages the Apriori algorithm in Python to analyze and understand the associations and patterns in ‚Ä¢ 
‚Ä¢ customer purchase behavior. The primary goal is to transform raw transaction data into actionable insights that can drive business growth, enhance customer experiences, and boost revenue.
### Project Highlights
 ‚Ä¢ Apriori Algorithm: At the core of this project is the Apriori algorithm, a sophisticated tool for mining frequent item sets within vast datasets. Python is the driving force behind implementing this algorithm, enabling efficient processing and analysis.
 ‚Ä¢ Data Transformation: Extensive transaction data, including customer purchase histories and product attributes, is gathered and cleaned. Python libraries like Pandas are employed to manipulate and prepare the data for analysis.
 ‚Ä¢ Association Rules: The analysis doesn't stop at frequent item sets. Association rules are generated to provide a deeper understanding of which items tend to co-occur and influence each other. 
 ‚Ä¢ Data Visualization: Power BI is utilized to create insightful data visualizations that enable a user-friendly presentation of the findings.
### Data Source
- Dataset: The dataset used for this analysis contains transaction records from a e-commerce retail store, including product details and customer IDs.
- Data Preparation: Data preprocessing involved cleaning missing values and transforming the data into a suitable format.
### Tools Used
- Sql : For extract and transform data
- Python: For data analysis .
- PowerBI: For data visualization.
  Basket Analysis Chart visualization in Power BI:
### Basket Analysis Chart Visualization in Power BI
At the top of the dashboard, you'll find two filter options that allow you to select and apply filters to the other charts for a more focused analysis of specific baskets.
### Basket Analysis Network Chart:
 ‚Ä¢ The Basket Analysis Network Chart is a powerful tool for visualizing the relationships between items in your data.
 ‚Ä¢ This chart takes the form of a traditional Scatter chart, making it easy to spot trends and correlations.
### Understanding the Data:
 ‚Ä¢ It's important to note that when a product has connections with multiple other products, the number displayed is the sum of the lift for those various connections. While this number itself may seem meaningless, a higher value indicates that the product has significant Lift (relationships) with other products. This, in turn, suggests that the product warrants further analysis.
### Basket Analysis Map:
 ‚Ä¢ The Basket Analysis Map is a valuable feature that allows you to visualize the relationship between lift, support, and confidence in the baskets.
 ‚Ä¢ When you hover your mouse over a bubble, you can see not only the confidence but also the lift and support values, providing deeper insights into your data.
### Utilizing the Chart:
 ‚Ä¢ This chart serves as a powerful tool for analyzing your product sales and uncovering cross-selling opportunities.
 ‚Ä¢ By examining the relationships and correlations within your data, you can make data-driven decisions to boost your business's performance.
